# compiled_swift_static_lib

This repository shows how to compile Swift static libraries into static frameworks.

This repo follows my post [Distributing compiled iOS Swift static libraries and Swift static frameworks](https://medium.com/@anuragajwani/distributing-compiled-ios-swift-static-libraries-and-swift-static-frameworks-7fecc4f3d182) step by step guide on how to build static frameworks.
